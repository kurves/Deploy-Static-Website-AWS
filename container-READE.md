## Containers

### What is a Container?

OS level virtualization allows us to run multiple isolated processes in parallel. A container is an isolated process that consists of the following items, all bundled into one package:

the application code,
the required dependencies (e.g. libraries, utilities, configuration files), and
the necessary runtime environment to run the application.

### Benefit of Containers

Containers make it easier for developers to create, deploy, and run applications on different hardware and platforms, quickly and easily.
Containers share a single kernel and share application libraries.
Containers cause a lower system overhead as compared to Virtual Machines.
