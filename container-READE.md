## Containers

What is a Container?
OS level virtualization allows us to run multiple isolated processes in parallel. A container is an isolated process that consists of the following items, all bundled into one package:

the application code,
the required dependencies (e.g. libraries, utilities, configuration files), and
the necessary runtime environment to run the application.
