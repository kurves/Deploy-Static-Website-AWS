## Logging in the Cloud

Logging provides visibility into your cloud resources and applications. For applications that run in the cloud, you will need access to logging and auditing services to help you proactively monitor your resources and applications.

### Cloud Trail

Cloud Trail allows you to audit (or review) everything that occurs in your AWS account. Cloud Trail does this by recording all the AWS API calls occurring in your account and delivering a log file to you.
